Ever get mad at someone in chat and want to put them on timeout? Have a full ignore list or think a complete ignore is too much?

A solution has arrived!

Muted players no longer show up in the chat box just as if they were ignored. There is no limit to the number of players you can mute!
Unlike a complete ignore, you can still exchange mail, trade, etc. with a muted player.

To mute someone, simply right-click their name in the chat window and select "Mute."

Slash Commands:
/mutelist - lists the names of players you have muted in chat. One player per line.
/unmute x - unmute the provided player name (replace the x with the name).

Caveats:
@names and character names are muted separately. You may need to mute someone twice if you wish to not see what they have to say in both zone and guild, for example.
